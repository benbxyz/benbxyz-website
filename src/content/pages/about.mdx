Beneath flickering neon lights and the hum of CRT monitors, I write code like it’s 1985 — because in my world, it still is. I’m a digital ghost in the machine, a synth-loving coder with one foot in the forest and the other plugged into the grid.

By day, I disappear into misty trails and starlit campsites. By night, I drift through the datastream — crafting websites that echo with the pulse of synths, the static of VHS tapes, and the chaos of code.

I don’t just build web experiences — I engineer nostalgia. If it glows, glitches, or growls with analog soul, I’m already ten steps ahead. Languages I speak fluently: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, TypeScript, Golang, Ruby + Rails and fluent sarcasm.

This site is my neon-drenched hideout — a place where old-school tech meets futurepunk vibes. If you’re looking for someone who can merge retro aesthetics with cutting-edge functionality, jack in.

Stay strange. Stay curious. Stay glitched.
